# Live Clock

#### Overview
The live clock code is a simple JavaScript program that displays the current time in real-time on a web page. It updates the displayed time every second without requiring the page to be refreshed.

#### Files
The live clock code consists of an HTML file, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for functionality.
- index.html: This file contains the structure of the web page and includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- styles.css: This file contains styles to format the appearance of the clock, including font size, alignment, and color.
- script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for updating the time displayed on the web page.

#### HTML Structure
The HTML structure includes a "<h1>" element where the current time is displayed. The "<script>" tag at the end of the body loads the JavaScript file to enable the functionality.

#### CSS Styles
The CSS styles define the appearance of the clock, including font size, alignment, font family, and color.

#### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code fetches the current time from the system clock and updates the content of the "<h1>" element with the current time every second using the setInterval() function.

The showTime() function retrieves the current time, formats it, and updates the content of the "<h1>" element with the formatted time.

#### Usage
To use the live clock code, simply include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your web project. Make sure all files are in the same directory. When the HTML file is opened in a web browser, the current time will be displayed and updated in real-time.

#### Customization
You can customize the appearance of the clock by modifying the CSS styles in the styles.css file.
You can adjust the time format or add additional features to the clock by modifying the JavaScript code in the script.js file.

#### Dependencies
The live clock code does not have any external dependencies and relies solely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for functionality.

#### Compatibility
The live clock code should work on most modern web browsers that support JavaScript. It does not require any specific browser extensions or plugins.
